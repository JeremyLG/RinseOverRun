# RinseOverRun

RinseOverRun Competition : top 68 over 1200 participants

But I didn't have time to try hard the competition, only did 4 submissions...
No beautiful ML or featuring, nothing much interesting here

### Technologies used

- **H2O** for fast prototyping and submissions
- **PyTorch** for exploring this techno and look into implementation of basic VAE

### Warning

Dirty repo, not organized, code not cleaned up.

It's kinda a dirty mix between exploration code and industrialised pipeline codes.
So It's unreadable.
